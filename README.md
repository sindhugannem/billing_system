Project billing is the process of setting rates, preparing invoices, and collecting payments for your project work. The billing process presents risks for both the service provider and the customer, depending on how it's handled.

8 Stages of project billing

There’s much more to project billing than simply sending an invoice and receiving payment. We’ve broken the billing cycle down into eight stages. 
1. Project planning

When planning any type of project, you must have a clear picture of details like:

    The project scope and deliverables
    Required activities and resources needed to complete the project
    The client’s goals
    Timelines for the completion of the project
    Any risks associated with the project

All this information is vital to estimating the project cost accurately.

Something that would help at this stage is a tool like Rocketlane that provides reusable project templates so you don’t forget any steps while planning your project.
2. Resource planning

Consider the equipment, facilities, human resources, and materials you’ll need. Record details of each as a separate line item in an accounting software.

Additionally, consider when you’ll require those resources and plan around potential constraints.

You can then begin to plan resource allocation for specific teams and activities.

With Rocketlane, you can automate your resource allocation and get high-level visibility into which resources are available throughout the project.
3. Setting a billing rate

Once you’ve planned the project and know what resources you’ll need, you can decide on your billing rate and standard billing schedule. You can then prepare a quote for the client.

You should consider the following when creating your quote:

    Estimated billable hours needed to complete the project, multiplied by the hourly rate of each team member’s rate card
    Expected billable expenses
    Any flat fees for specific tasks within the project
    A billable amount to contribute toward your overheads

Along with project plans, Rocketlane allows you to set and track billable rates and hours for accurate job costing and billing.
4. Discussing the quote and setting a budget

If the initial quote doesn't convince the client, you may need to negotiate a billing rate that works for both of you. 

To win the client’s full confidence, you can present them with Rocketlane’s accurate budget reports and forecasts.

Once you’ve agreed on a budget with the client, set an internal budget to ensure project profitability.

For best results when setting a budget, you should:

    Decide on a desired profit margin.
    Review historical budget data from previous projects.
    Plan reserves for cost overruns.

5. Staying on budget while running the project

During project work, you must stick to your project budget. Check in regularly to ensure you’re staying within your expected margins.

You should track your team’s hours of work for accurate hourly billing and productivity management. 

Rocketlane’s in-depth project management and time tracking features can help with this too.
6. Generating invoices

When you arrive at the agreed project milestones, it’s time to create an invoice.

Depending on your project billing type, you may need to perform job costing to tabulate time and project expenses at this stage.

You can then use invoicing and billing software to create a customized invoice for your service. It helps to create a draft invoice template to ensure consistency across invoices.
7. Sending invoices

After preparing the invoice, share it with the client. This could be via email or on a centralized document portal like the one Rocketlane provides.

Be sure the invoice is timely, accurate, and includes clear payment terms.
8. Collecting payments

Finally, you can collect your earnings.

Your invoice should allow the client to pay the invoiced amount of money easily via a selection of online payment gateways.

If you nail each of these steps, your customers should have no qualms with payment.
